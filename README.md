# braindead_clone 

This is a clone of my favorite clothing brand's website: wearebraindead.com

I followed this CSS/HTML tutorial from supersimpledev: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc
In the tutorial, we create a clone of the youtube home page. This inspired me to create my own clone.

I gave myself one week to complete it. Which is why it may seem somewhat unfinished. There are some aspects that I simply did not have time to learn how to implement. 
Im still unfirmiliar with creating eventlistners in js, which may aid in creating some aesthetically nice dropdown menus.
I also had a very hard time replicating the shadows on the backdrop photos.

I also didn't really include any links. Doing it is super simple (just like supersimpledev, LOL), and I just didn't feel like spending time on it when I had much more
important features to learn.

I plan on learning about event listeners and js for website building. Then coming back and making the clone much more responsive and animated.

For now, I welcome any critiques or help on best practices, different ways of styling, or whatever anyone has for me.

Thanks, yall.
